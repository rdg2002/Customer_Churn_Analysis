# Customer_Churn_Analysis

The Customer Churn Analysis project investigates customer churn by analyzing key factors such as contract type, payment methods, and customer tenure. The findings highlight that customers on month-to-month contracts and those paying via electronic checks are significantly more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts or using more stable payment methods. Additionally, the analysis reveals that customer retention is critical within the first year, as churn rates are highest during this period. The visualizations included in the project help illustrate these patterns, emphasizing the need for targeted retention strategies.

Recommendations:
1] Promote Long-Term Contracts: Offer incentives for customers to commit to longer contracts to reduce churn.
2] Address Payment Method Concerns: Implement campaigns encouraging customers to switch from electronic checks to more reliable payment methods.
3] Customer Engagement in Early Tenure: Focus on improving the customer experience within the first year, as churn is highest in this period.
4] Special Senior Citizen Retention Programs: Create personalized offers or assistance programs to retain the senior demographic.

In summary, the project offers actionable insights to reduce churn, particularly by focusing on optimizing contract structures, payment methods, and engagement during the critical early tenure phase.
